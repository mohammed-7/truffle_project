The steps in initiating truffle and creating a project
installation of truffle command npm install -g truffle
after installation we can check the version of truffle with command - truffle version 
Creating the project: mkdir Metacoin
                     cd Metacoin 
now after creating a project we download unbox using command - truffle unbox metacoin / if we need to create just a truffle project we can initiate it with command truffle init.
